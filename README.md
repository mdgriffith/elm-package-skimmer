# The Elm Skimmer

Browse elm packages as well as github projects that contain elm code!

Elm related projects that do not contain elm code are added on a per-case basis through the [whitelist]().  If you have a project that you think the elm-skimmer should track, make a PR to the whitelist.

Have an idea of a metric that would be useful for elm-skimmer to track? [Mention it in this issue.](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-package-skimmer/issues/1)
